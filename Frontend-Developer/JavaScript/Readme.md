## Introduction

### What is JavaScript????


Along with [HTML]() and [CSS](), the computer language known as JavaScript, or JS, is one of the foundational elements of the World Wide Web. It enables us to add interactivity to pages, such as the sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc. that you may have encountered on various websites. It is used in non-browser settings as well, such as [Node.js]() for writing server-side JavaScript code, Electron for creating desktop apps, [React Native]() for creating mobile applications, and others, in addition to the browser.
