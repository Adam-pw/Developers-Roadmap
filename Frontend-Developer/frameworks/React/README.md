# Roadmap to learn React

## What to learn before you start React ?
* Git/Github
* Basic javascript
* npm / yarn
* To work efficiently in terminal
* and ofcourse basic html and css.

## What is React.js?
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications.React can be used to build single-page applications (SPAs) and can be combined with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux, React Router, and Next.js, to create more complex applications.

## Why to learn React ?
React allows developers to build complex UIs by breaking them down into small, reusable components that can be easily managed and updated. 

## THE Roadmap !
 ### 1. __Learn the basics of__
 * __HTML:__ In HTML, you should know Basics of all tags, new features, and support in HTML5, About how to work with emmets and about divs.

 * __CSS:__ In CSS, you should know about Box model mainly, and the basic styling.

 * __JavaScript:__ Javascript is the most integral prerequisite if you want to start React. It adds interactivity and dynamics in the HTML document. It is a client-side scripting language. To take inputs from users, validate them, display alerts etc., we use JavaScript.
 <br> Following are the important points to consider: 

-Functions <br>
-Strings <br>
-Array manipulation <br>
-Loops <br>
-Printing alerts <br>
-Logging on consoles <br>

### 2. __The basic Tools you'll need-__
* <ins> __Git / Github:__</ins> In github, you need to learn- 
1. How to create a repository.<br>
2. The basic git commands such as how to push your code.<br>
3. How to create branches and how to open a pull request.<br>
4. And, Version control.


*  __VS Code/ Atom or <ins>any code editor</ins> you're comfortable with.__

* <ins>__Package Managers :__ </ins>
You'll need package managers like Npm or Yarn. These are tools used to manage the packages and libraries. You can choose the package manager of your choice. 


* <ins>__Libraries for better styling:__</ins>
Few third party libraries such as React Bootstrap, Mantine etc would make your application's styling much better and easier.

* <ins>__Working with API's:__</ins>
1. __Fetch API__: The Fetch API is a built-in JavaScript API that allows you to make HTTP requests to an API endpoint and retrieve data. Understanding how to use the Fetch API is essential when working with APIs in React.<br>
2. __React Hooks__: React Hooks are a way to add state and other React features to functional components. The useEffect() Hook is often used when working with APIs, as it allows you to perform side effects, such as making API requests, when a component is rendered.<br>
3. __Promises:__ The Fetch API returns a Promise, which is a JavaScript object that represents a value that may not be available yet. Understanding how to work with Promises and handle asynchronous data in React is important when working with APIs. 
4. __GET and POST requests:__ GET and POST are two of the most common HTTP methods used in APIs to retrieve or send data, respectively.

* <ins>__Routing, Navigation and loading:__</ins>
Routing and navigation are important concepts in web development, as they allow users to navigate between different pages or views within a web application.
