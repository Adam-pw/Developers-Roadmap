<!-- The field of frontend development, which is expanding quickly, is in charge of giving online pages life. It entails utilising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design websites that are both user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Learning frontend development can be a terrific opportunity whether you are just starting out in your career or looking to transfer professions.

Step:1 - Learn HTML & CSS.

The basic building components of web pages are HTML and CSS. A web page's structure is provided by HTML, and styling and visual effects are added using CSS. It's imperative to have a firm grasp on these two technologies before delving into JavaScript.

Step 3:- Build Projects.

Building projects is a great opportunity to put your knowledge to use and develop your abilities. Create simple projects first, like a to-do list or a calculator, and then progress to more difficult ones.
